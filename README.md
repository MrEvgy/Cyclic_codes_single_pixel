# Cyclic_codes_single_pixel

Our paper "Single pixel imaging at megahertz switching rates via cyclic Hadamard masks" shows a method to achieve MHz switching rates for single pixel imaging by enabling rapid bases swithcing with cyclic spatial codes. The method is demonstrated by capturing images with rates as high as 2.4 Mega samples / sec and moving objects imaging at 72 fps.

This is the code compatible with the papers figures and the data (that shoud be placed in a "data" folder) is found at:
