# Cyclic_codes_single_pixel

Our paper shows a method to achieve MHz switching rates for single pixel imaging by proposing a cyclic spatial coding method. The method is demonstrated by capturing moving C.elegance worms at 72 fps.

The repocitory includes an example of the Matlab reconstruction code for Fig.3.a of the main paper.
Image of a resolution target with N = 25111 pixels with size 4x0.75 um and M=56 sub-pixel shifted samples.
The code samples the reconstruction time per sub-pixel shift image and presents the average reconstruction time.

main script performs the analysis on the data stored in the data file.
